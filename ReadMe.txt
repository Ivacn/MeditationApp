Meditation Application
It's an easy, fun, and accessible way to do meditation.

Project Description:
I wanted to create an easy and joyful way to do meditation so I designed this application.
Firstly the user can sign in or sign up for this application.  Also users can enter their personal information to find different types of meditation themes . It depends on the user's mood and also a choice. The main part contains a timer, time selector, and also a theme that you can choose. When you decide your choice there is a video that plays in the background and at the same time, you can listen to relaxing and calming sounds. Additionally, there is a timer that you can stop or continue. 

Technologies that I used:
For the front-end part, I used application javascript, HTML, and CSS. And for the back-end I used SQL.
